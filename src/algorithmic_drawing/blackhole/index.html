            <h2>How does that work ?</h2>
            <p>
                I first traced lines going on a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle">
                    trigonometric circle
                </a>
                at the center using sinus and cosinus. <br />
                Then I place a black ellipse slightly smaller.<br />
                Then I traced (with the help of AI because I'm not THAT GOOD at
                math) lines that as they gradually reach a certain range, their
                starting point drift from the center, their end point is the
                position on the trigonometric circle
            </p>

                It work like that :
                <ul>
                    <li>Any live cell with fewer than two ore more than three live neighbours dies</li>
                    <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives</li>
                    <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell</li>
